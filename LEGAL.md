## License
License files are provided at the root of the repository. License files at the root of the repository not indicators of the licensing of the whole repository. Licenses specified by a Cargo.toml or by the placing of a valid copyright license at within a directory other than the root directory take presence over provisions 1 and 2. In cases where both licensing provisions 1 and 2 apply both licenses apply where posable. President provided by the license or timing of license application may prevent this. Each cargo package and interface file is licensed independently unless otherwise stated.

### 1: Interface and Example License Information
Interfaces and examples are provided under the [BSD-3-Clause](./LICENSE-BSD3.txt) license. All files and files within subdirectories within a directory named "wit" are interfaces. All cargo packages within a directory named "examples" are examples.

### 2: Runner License Information
Runners are provided under the [GPL-3.0-only](./LICENSE-GPLv3.txt) license. A Runner is any cargo package that is not within an examples directory.
